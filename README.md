# writing-a-basic-javascript-app

### What is this?

NOTE: The index.php file is only there for integration with heroku.

This is an example repository that will contain
* An example simple javascript application.
* Some basic guidelines to make it.
* The commit history of making the javascript application.
    
The hope is that this can serve as an example to getting started with your own.
